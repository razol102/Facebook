C++ objects oriented project: This project aims to simulate the core functionalities of a simplified Facebook environment. Through this endeavor, I delved into the fundamentals of C++ and object-oriented design, implementing features such as user creation, friend requests, posting updates, and more. As a beginner's exploration into the world of programming, this project reflects my initial steps in understanding object-oriented concepts and applying them to create a basic simulation of a social networking platform. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback as I continue to learn and grow in my programming journey.
